In the matching algorithm the main thing is making a database with 1 table with a start and end date and a 
column for every matching criteria. If you have 5 matching criteria you would have 5 columns. This 5 columns
can be reduced to 1 column by giving and id to every combination that is in the table.

So if you have the columns pid, date_exposed,ST_date,EN_date, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5

Then take "SELECT DISTINCT m1, m2, m3, m4, m5 FROM ABOVE" and add an id, such as the row id and apply this to the table of above.

Then in the matching you have a table  pid, date_exposed,ST_date,EN_date, status_id

This will make that the matcing query is faster because lees expression need to be evaluated and because the table is leander.

Moreover, when you aim on match for several cohorts this table can also more easaly appended to another long table with multiple T0 per subject

You may then end up with pid, date_exposed,ST_date,EN_date, status_id, cohort

Then when picking 1 match of all the possible matches you need to order by pid_exposed and cohort
